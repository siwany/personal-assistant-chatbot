# BSMS program
The Georgia Tech BS/MS program is an accelerated pathway that allows qualified undergraduates to begin graduate-level coursework while completing their bachelor’s degree. Through this program, students can apply up to six hours of approved graduate or cross-listed courses to both degrees, effectively reducing the time needed to earn a master’s.(mostly 1 year) Designed for high-achieving students, the BS/MS program streamlines the process of earning two degrees, enabling participants to finish their master’s in as little as one additional year after completing their bachelor’s.
